# Biologycal-sequence-analyzer
This Python program include classes and methods to analyze biological sequences (DNA, RNA and amino acid).
More specifically, include the following methods. 
•	A method to return the sequence type.
•	Methods to calculate nucleotide base counts in DNA and RNA sequences. The same methods should be able to plot a graph to compare each base count and save it in a figure.
•	Methods to calculate AT content in DNA and RNA sequences.
•	Methods to calculate GC content in DNA and RNA sequences.
•	A method to compare AT and GC contents of two given input nucleotide sequences using a suitable graph.
•	A method to transcribe an DNA sequence.
•	A method to generate all possible combinations of 3-mers and 4-mers given the constituent bases.
•	A method to translate an mRNA sequence.
•	A method to calculate the hydrophobicity of a given amino acid sequence.
•	A method to calculate the molecular weight of a given amino acid sequence.
